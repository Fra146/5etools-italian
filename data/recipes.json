Arrange half the chicken skin-side down in the Dutch oven, adjust the heat to medium, and cook, undisturbed, until the skin is browned, about 5 minutes. Turn over the chicken and continue to cook, undisturbed, until the second side is browned, about 5 minutes more; adjust the heat if it starts to scorch. Transfer the chicken to a large plate. Repeat with the remaining chicken thighs (and reserve any accumulated chicken fat). When the chicken is cool enough to handle, remove and discard the skin.",
				"Thinly slice one of the leek halves. Cut the remaining three leek halves into 1-inch pieces.",
				"Add the butter to the pot, return it to medium heat, and melt and swirl in the pot to coat. Add the thinly sliced leeks, bay leaves, thyme, and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring constantly, until the leeks are softened, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and flour and continue to cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes more. Add the sherry and bring to a simmer, stirring and scraping the pan bottom to loosen and dissolve any browned bits. Continue to simmer, stirring, until the liquid is thickened and slightly reduced, about 1 minute more. Gradually add the broth, stirring vigorously to incorporate it smoothly.",
				"Add the chicken thighs with any of the accumulated juices to the pot and return to a simmer. Adjust the heat to very low, cover, and simmer gently until the chicken is cooked through and very tender, about 1 hour, turning the chicken pieces over after about 30 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate.",
				"When the chicken is cool enough to handle, remove the meat from the bones and shred it into large chunks. Remove the bay leaves from the pot, add the shredded chicken, ½ teaspoon salt, and a few grinds of pepper; stir to mix. Over medium-high heat, return to a simmer. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, if necessary.",
				"MEANWHILE, MAKE THE DUMPLINGS. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, onion powder, salt, and a few grinds of pepper in a bowl. Add the scallions and toss to combine. In a microwave-safe bowl, microwave the butter and olive oil (or reserved chicken fat, if you have any), stopping to swirl occasionally, to melt the butter. Add the milk and continue to microwave on high until the mixture is just warm (do not overheat), about 1½ minutes. Add the warmed milk mixture to the flour mixture. With a wooden spoon or fork, mix until incorporated and uniformly moist (the mixture should look like a wet, shaggy dough).",
				"To finish the chicken and cook the dumplings, add the carrots, celery, 1-inch leek pieces, and most of the parsley to the stew and stir to incorporate it. Using a soup spoon, drop twelve golf ball–size portions of dumpling dough into the pot, placing them about ½ inch apart (drop eight around the perimeter and four in the center). Adjust the heat to low, cover, and cook undisturbed until the dumplings are puffed and cooked through, and a toothpick inserted into them comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes.",

Remove the top parchment sheet. If necessary, using your fingers, gently loosen the long edge of the pastry nearest you from the bottom piece of parchment paper (this will make it easier to begin rolling it with the filling). Evenly spread the room-temperature butter over the pastry and sprinkle the larger quantity of the sugar mixture over the butter, all the way to the edges.

It should still be cool, though, because warm puff pastry can become sticky. Finally, don't allow the baked buns to cool completely in the muffin tin, or they will stick to the cups.",

While every amaro producer has their own proprietary recipe that can include dozens of ingredients, these liqueurs are usually bittersweet (though some more bracingly bitter than others!) with a syrupy consistency. Here, we recommend a dark amaro for both color and depth of flavor. Try Averna for a more cola-like sweetness or Fernet if you have a taste for black licorice and the ultra-astringent."

Allow any excess batter to drip off, then slip them into the oil and fry until slightly puffed and pale gold, adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain 390°F, stirring to prevent sticking, and turning the pieces over in the oil once or twice to promote even frying, 5 to 6 minutes for each batch. With a spider skimmer, slotted spoon, or long tongs, transfer the tempura to the paper towel–lined baking sheet to drain for about 30 seconds. Sprinkle lightly with salt and place on the wire rack set on the baking sheet and put in the oven to keep warm. Allow the oil to recover to 390°F and fry the remaining batches.

Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is reduced by almost half, about 5 minutes. Add the cream and sugar and cook, stirring, until the liquid is reduced slightly and coats the back of a spoon, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat; add the mustard (if using), 1 tablespoon brandy, lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon of the chives; and stir to incorporate. Taste and adjust with salt, if necessary. Spoon the sauce over and around the steaks and sprinkle with the remaining chives. Serve at once."

				"In a medium skillet over medium heat, toast the coconut, stirring constantly, until many of the flakes are dark golden brown (some flakes will remain white, so the quantity will appear to be spotty brown), about 4 minutes. Immediately scrape the coconut into the bowl of a food processor, and set aside to cool to room temperature, at least 10 minutes. Pulse until it's about the texture of whole flax seeds (a little smaller than sunflower seeds), about five 2-second pulses, and set aside.",
				"Meanwhile, carefully wipe out the still-hot skillet. In the skillet, off heat, whisk ¼ cup of the flour and ½ cup of the water until it forms a smooth, thick paste (with help from the residual heat in the skillet) about the texture of mashed potatoes, about 1 minute. Immediately scrape the paste into the bowl of a stand mixer, and set aside to cool until tepid, about 8 minutes.",
				"Meanwhile, with a paring knife, halve the vanilla beans lengthwise and scrape the seeds from all six halves. Collect the seeds in a small dish, cover, and set aside.",
				"Add the milk to the flour paste and whisk until smooth. Add one egg and whisk to incorporate it. Add the remaining 2¼ cups flour and the yeast. Fit the bowl and the dough hook to the stand mixer and mix on low speed for 1 minute. Adjust the speed to medium-low and continue mixing until the flour is incorporated and the resulting mass is cohesive, about 30 seconds longer. Turn off the mixer and rest the dough for 15 minutes. Add the sugar and 1½ teaspoons salt and knead on medium-low speed for 5 minutes, until the dough appears smoother. With the mixer running, add one piece of the butter and continue mixing until it is incorporated fully into the dough, about 30 seconds, before adding the next. Repeat to add and incorporate the remaining three pieces of butter, adding the vanilla seeds along with the last piece. Continue to mix on medium-low speed 5 minutes longer, adding the coconut midway through that time and stopping when needed to scrape down the dough hook and sides of the bowl (the dough will be quite soft and sticky).",
				"Flour a work surface very lightly, scrape the dough from the bowl to the surface, and knead it briefly to form a ball. Lightly oil a medium bowl, add the dough, and turn it to coat very lightly with the oil. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and set aside until the dough has become puffy and its volume has increased by three-fourths or doubled, about 1 hour.",
				"Oil a 9-inch round cake pan, line the bottom with parchment paper, and oil the parchment paper. Transfer the dough to the work surface, gently deflate it, and press and stretch it into a 10 by 12-inch rectangle with a short side facing you. Cut the dough lengthwise into 4 equal strips and cut each strip crosswise into 3 equal pieces. Working with 1 piece of dough at a time, stretch and press the dough gently to form an 8 by 2-inch strip. Starting on a short side, roll the strip to form a snug cylinder. Arrange the shaped buns seam-side down in the prepared pan, placing 10 buns around the edge of the pan, pointing inward, and the remaining 2 buns in the center. Cover the pan with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and set aside until the buns appear puffy and their volume has increased by about three-fourths or doubled, about 1 hour.",
				"When ready to bake, with a rack in the lowest position, preheat the oven to 375°F. In a small bowl, beat the remaining egg with 1 tablespoon water. Gently brush the tops of the buns with the egg wash (take care not to deflate the dough) and bake until deep golden brown, 20 to 24 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. Set the pan on a cooling rack and cool for about 15 minutes. Gently loosen the edges of the buns with your fingers and gently pry them out of the pan. Cool the buns until just warm or room temperature, remove the parchment from the bottom of the buns if necessary, and serve. Leftover buns can be wrapped tightly and stored at room temperature for up to 3 days."

Using a very sharp knife, cut slits about 1 inch apart in a crosshatch pattern across the entire fat cap of the pork, taking care to cut all the way through the layer of fat, but not into the meat beneath it. Sprinkle the brown sugar-salt mixture all over the pork, making sure to rub it into the slits. Wrap the meat tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 12 hours or up to 24 hours.",

Place the pork on the prepared roasting rack, fat cap-side up, and pour the water into the pan, making sure it does not touch the bottom of the pork. Roast until the pork is very tender (a paring knife should slip in and out of the meat very easily) and the meat near the bone (but not touching it) registers 190°F on an instant-read thermometer, about 5 hours, checking once or twice on the water level in the roasting pan. If there is less than ¾ cup, add more. Transfer the pork to a platter or carving board, cover loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 30 minutes. Pour the liquid from the roasting pan into a fat separator or a narrow, heatproof container, and allow it to settle for 10 minutes. Set aside 2 tablespoons of the fat for the sauce and discard the rest.",

Roast until the cracklings are dark, blistered, and crisp, 8 to 10 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. Return the pork to the platter or carving board, cover loosely with foil, and let rest for 15 minutes longer.",
